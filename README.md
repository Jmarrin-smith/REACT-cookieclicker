all requirements were achived and understood,  props was a little difficult to get my head around and im sure with more use as we move on to next.js ill get there 

in session preformance during development was lowerd by things outside of development and i need to look to improve that moving foward

I heavily use outside sources during development to improove understanding of concepts and problem solve,
i often query google with a specific genrally worded question leading to a result of the specific question being answered on stack overflow
then taking that answer and searching the key concepts using websites like mdn to then derunify those answers when needed and then adapting the code
to solve my problem and work in my format 

during the week i made a project planning document thqat listed the specific things i needed to learn and the ways in which they would need to be implemented in this assignment.
this shortened development time massively and i will be continuing to do this as a result 

i had difficulty with render and will need to look further into web hosting in order to speed up and further understand the process
